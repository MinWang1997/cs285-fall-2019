Questions:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Which value estimator has better performance without advantage-standardization: the trajectory-centric one, or the one using reward-to-go?
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Using reward-to-go is always better.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Did advantage standardization help?
    \begin{itemize}
        \item In these configurations, there is no evidence that it helps
    \end{itemize}
    \item Did the batch size make an impact?
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Yes. The model converges significantly faster with larger batch size.
    \end{itemize}

\end{itemize}
